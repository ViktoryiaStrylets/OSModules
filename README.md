# OSModules
<p>
<em>Operating System Project</em> is a collection of modules that together implement a modern-day operating system. 
Each module performs a basic operating system service such as device scheduling, CPU scheduling, interrupt handling, file management, memory management, process management, resource management, and interprocess communication. 
The Project also includes comparisons and statistics of performance of the modules when using different techniques and algorithms of implementing they core functionalities like different the Page replacement algorithms, various Fetch and Cleaning Policies in Memory Module, different scheduling algorithms
for the sequence of I/O requests in Device Management etc.
